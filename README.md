# SFM Notes 

## 1. Introduction
I am trying to work through some notes on structure from motion found at [https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/course_notes/](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/course_notes/). Mostly I am trying to write my own routines, anc sometimes compare the with OpenCV routines.
